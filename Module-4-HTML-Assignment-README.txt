Hello, and Welcome to my Module 4 HTML Assignment!

In this project I implemented multiple HTML codes that allowed me to create a basic webpage.

Form Creation

	In this section of the project I created a submit form with multiple inputs that the user could enter personal information.

	Key Concepts Implemented:

	•Text input that allowed the user to enter their name into a form submission section.
	•Email input that allowed the user to enter their email address.
	•Text Area that allowed the user to enter in their own thoughts into the webpage.
•(Bonus Entry): As a bonus entry I entered in both a "How did you hear about us" field along with a "rate our survey" using the radio input.

Table Structure

	In this part of the project I created a basic market accurate table that
	included multiple products, their price, and the quantity of that item when purchased.

•(Bonus Entry): The bonus for this section was to add a table header that labeled each column. I also added a slight border
		to the table to give it dimension making it more visually appealing.

Navigation Bar

	In this section I created a simple navigation bar that the user could use to move across the webpage with ease
	including the Home page, About page, and Contact page.
	
	Key Concepts Implemented:
	•Unorganized list that organized each hyperlink for ease of access to the user.

Adding Images

	In this section of the project I inserted two images into the webpage using a placeholder URL.

	Key Concepts Implemented:
	•(Bonus Entry): I inserted a second image and using the style input I was able to make a round border for the second photo of the webpage.
